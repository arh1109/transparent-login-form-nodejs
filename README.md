# transparent-login-form-nodejs

Simple app I designed for one of my final projects in college. This repository is used along with another repo here. <https://github.com/arh1109/node-exp-rest-api-demo>

Here is a design for my app. This project only contains the rightmost Node.js app and serves the register.html and login.html files.
